Tracking and visualizing traffic accidents, injuries, and fatalities in Tallahassee, FL

### Potential Data Sources
| Data Source | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV)](https://www.flhsmv.gov/traffic-crash-reports/crash-dashboard/)  | The official repository for crash reports and maintains the crash reports for 10 years. To access it, send an email to CrashPRR@FLHSMV.gov specifying the non-redacted data for the desired year(s) and/or quarter. Raw crash data is in an Excel format. The data is on a disc; with one year per disc and quarterly discs for the current year, 2021. Each disc is $6.00  |

### Next Steps
1. Obtain crash records from FLHSMV
2. Build data pipeline to clean and import records into a MongoDB database
