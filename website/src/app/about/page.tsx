              Open Tallahassee
            </a>
            &nbsp; is an open journalism project, powered by residents who just
            want to keep their neighbors informed & connected - without diving
            into the rabbit hole of political conspiracies or drama.
          </span>

            Open Tallahassee started at a Tallahassee coffee shop, where its
            founding members talked about making a public map of traffic
            crashes, this map.
